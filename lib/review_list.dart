        "My house was flooded in April as it was in 2009 also. This time around I called 4 different companies out to give me an estimate on the crawlspace damage. 1 company never showed, never got an estimate from #2, #3 was a high estimate. Middle Tn Crawlspace was already working in the neighborhood so I asked them to give me an estimate. I had it before they left. The estimate was much more reasonable than the other and James was very knowledgeable and communicated well what was needed. I am very happy with the completed encapsulation. I would recommend Middle Tn to others in need of this type of service. They did a excellent job! What a difference it makes!",

        "We were having a moisture issue in our crawlspace. We made several calls and received quotes. And middle Tennessee crawlspace was by far the best choice we could have made. James and his team did an amazing job. Their price was more than reasonable and for the quality of their work they could have definitely asked for a lot more. James kept us informed about what he was doing and when he was doing it. He fixed the moisture issues and even the creaking in the floors. The time frame he gave was right on as well. If you need someone you can absolutely count on to do so the job right, give them a call. You won’t be disappointed.",

        "James did a phenomenal job on our Crawlspace Encapsulation !! We were in a time crunch in getting our Crawlspace up to codes for inspection and the pending sale of our house! James and his wife was heaven sent!! Yes!! Team work makes the dream work! James was knowledgeable and gave some education as well on the issues and how he was going to remedy them! Not to mention red flags to look for in our new home going forward! If that isn’t a full service experience, I don’t know what is! We also had some issues with improper joist support and duct work maintenance , which was also taken care of by James with the help of his wife!! What a dynamic team!! Our Crawlspace looks amazing!!! But above that the job was done with precision, and great quality! Did I mention that Middle Tennessee Crawlspace’s prices were very reasonable? You get good QUALITY work for a great price!! Give this company a chance to earn your business.. you will not regret it!!",

        "Our late 1950's home was in dire need of fixing our crawl space. When we looked in the space, we saw standing water, mold-damaged rafters, and a terrible odor that was dangerously unhealthy James McCashland of Middle Tennessee Crawlspace answered our call for help immediately. He thoroughly inspected the problem and, without giving a sales pitch, he explained what was needed and alternative options. Mr. McCashland gave us a Tennessee Crawlspace quote that would get rid of the water, repair rafters, remediate mold and totaly encapsulate the space. Not only was his quote very affordable, but it guaranteed the job would be the completed within the following week. He was wrong about that. All work was done, debris removed, and obnoxious order elimated in 3 days. I would certainly recommend James McCashland's Middle Tennessee Crawlspace to any person looking for affordable, prompt and honest company!",

        "Hired mid 10 crawl to perform complete encapsulation of 2500 ft 45-year-old crawl space. They removed all old debris and old plastic vapor barrier, installed clean white threaded vapor barrier up the walls and across the floors, sealed all openings, taped up all joints and piers, installed LED lighting, added a new power line and dehumidifier treated the joists for mold and treated the ground to reduce mold and organism growth. Midtencrawls price was far below the big name companies. They provided excellent reliable and efficient personal service which *you will not get from a big name national company with fancy color brochures*. I know this for a fact because I had bids from those three other big companies and I turned them all down. Owner James McCasland is very knowledgeable and inspired a lot of confidence. He pointed out things which the three other companies did not either know about or did not bother to mention. Highly recommend this company.",

The top reason was pricing and my neighbor was having his crawlspace encapsulated and felt his information, price, and knowledge was valid. James had also worked for other companies that do encapsulation and knows the truthfulness of their promises. James was very knowledgeable about his craft, soils and what the overall key performance indicator hed be expecting. Basically, humidity and moisture goals(there is a difference I learned). James and his team provided excellent service and went above and beyond the general work that was required.",

        "Honest, Affordable, Exceptional: Middle Tennessee Crawlspace. Middle Tennessee Crawlspace saved us thousands of dollars! James' bid was straightforward and honest, recommending only the essentials. If you're looking for an honest bid, steer clear of those big companies that try to recoup their advertising expenses. One such company told me I needed a dehumidifier and three sump pumps, but James provided us with exactly what we needed at nearly half the cost. He installed a high-quality 100-pint dehumidifier with a built-in pump that drains directly into our plumbing line. James exemplifies exceptional customer service and operates with the highest standards of integrity. He considers a job complete only when his customers are completely satisfied. He and his crew finished our crawlspace encapsulation on time and within the agreed budget, and the quality of their work is truly stunning. The team worked quickly, was friendly, and left the job site clean. I wholeheartedly recommend Middle Tennessee Crawlspace, and I wouldn't hesitate to hire them again.

He came to our home, looked at the crawlspace and upon completion of the inspection walked us through what he saw and believes we needed. Not only did he find three major issues that the others never mentioned but his quote was HALF of what this major company quoted. James and his guys were able to start right away. He was professional, proficient, and he kept us updated on the process and what we should see in the space and feel in the air in the house once they were finished. He even recommended an electrician to place a new plug for the dehumidifier in the crawlspace. He was a gem as well and we've hired him to do more electrical work.

        "They were affordable . They finished by the time they mentioned. The odor went away instantly. My crawlspace smells great now. I am able to store my stuff without worrying about it getting ruined. My wife and I are very happy. Great customer service. I would definitely recommend. Looking forward to the health benefits due to better air quality. They went above and beyond what was expected.",

        "Middle Tennessee Crawlspace was a lifesaver during our home buying process. We noticed a mildew smell inside of the house, and they came out during our inspection and surveyed both the attic and crawlspace. They provided WAY more information than the home inspector, as well as reasonable quotes to remedy the moisture and insulation problems if purchased. I highly recommend Middle Tennessee Crawlspace to anyone!",

        "What a wonderful experience. The owner and his lovely wife came and removed an oversized refrigerator and a stove for me. They were so polite and kind. They were very professional and easy to talk to. I will definitely call them again for my next project. The company does much more than just crawlspaces, so if you need any handyman stuff done you should absolutely give them a call.",
